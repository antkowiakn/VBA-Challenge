VBA-Challenge
For this challenge I created a script that looped through all of the stocks for the years 2014-2016.
I created a summary table to the right of all of the raw data that has the following information.
A tiker symbol for each stock. 
A yearly change from the opening price and the closing price for the entire year, that has conditional formatting so if the change that is postive it is green, and if there was a negative change for the year it shows as red. 
From the yearly change of price I added another column that has the percentage change from the opening/closing price for the year.
Finally, I added a volume calculation that added the total volume over the corse of the year.
